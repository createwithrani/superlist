Thank you for considering contributing to the Superlist Block project! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including bug fixes, feature development, documentation improvements, and more.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/superlist-block.git
   ```
3. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make Changes**: Make your changes in the codebase. Be sure to follow the project's coding style and conventions.
5. **Open a Pull Request**: Once you have made your changes, push your branch to your forked repository and open a pull request against the `main` repository.
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then, go to the original repository and click on "New Pull Request". Select your branch and provide a clear description of your changes.
6. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by the maintainers. They may request changes or provide feedback. Be open to suggestions and make any necessary adjustments.
7. **Merge**: Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main branch. You will be notified when this happens.

## Branching Strategy
- `main` Branch: All development work should be merged into the main branch. This is the default branch for active development.
- `production` Branch: The production branch contains the officially released code. Only stable and tested changes from the main branch are merged into production.

## Merging to `production`
Once your changes have been merged into the `main` branch and thoroughly tested, they may be merged into the production branch by a maintainer for an official release. There is no set release schedule, but we aim to release new versions regularly. If you have a specific feature or bug fix that you believe should be included in the next release, please open an issue or pull request to discuss it with the maintainers.

## Reporting Issues
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue in the repository. Provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and address the problem.
